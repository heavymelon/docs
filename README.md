# What is Supportress?

Supportress is a simple and affordable helpdesk SaaS product. It allows you to offer customer support to your customers through email. You can hit the ground and running with customer support in minutes.

It is built with other SaaS companies in mind.

It is opinionated and its goal is to allow you to support your customers without switching too much context. Use one tool for the whole lifecycle:

* Receive a customer support request \(we call those discussions\)
* Investigate/collaborate with your fellow support or your product and engineering teams
* Capture customer feedback and bugs
* Fix problems or improve your product
* Get back to your customers to let them know their topic has been handled
