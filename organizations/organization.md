# Organization

An organization represents your business. When you sign up you are creating your first organization along with your personal owner account.

### Members

As an owner of an organization in Supportress, you can invite members to it. You can choose to invite your support staff only, but we recommend that you invite all staff.

We don't charge per seat ðŸ˜‰

### Queues

Queues are like your email inboxes. Your new organization starts with a default queue. It's where new customer supoprt requests end up in.

### Discussions

Support tickets? Nope. We call them discussions. Because that's what you do. You talk to people, with a human voice. It's not a ticket. It's a discussion.

### Custom domains

Set up your own custom domain so that you can send and receive email directly through `yourcompany.com` addresses.
