# Name

Every queue has a human readable name, like _Sales_ for example, and a slug. The slug is visible in some URLs your customers can see. The slug for a queue named _Account Support_ would be `account-support` for example.

You can change the name of a queue in:

* `Queue > Edit`
* Then type in a new `Name` and hit `Update queue`
