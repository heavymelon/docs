# Native email address

Every queue has a native email address people can use to start discussions. The email address always follows the same pattern:

```text
<queue-slug>@<organization-subdomain>.supportress.com
```

For example, If your queue slug is `sales` and your organization subdomain is `best-product` then your native email address for that queue would be:

```text
sales@best-product.supportress.com
```
