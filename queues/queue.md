# Queue

### Incoming

Queues are where discussions live. A queue has a unique email address. You share it with your customers. If you want to use an existing support email address you can auto-forward the emails to Supportress.

### Import a discussion

[Forward any email as an attachment](../forwarding-as-attachment-in-gmail.md) to Supportress, and see a new discussion as if your customer had originally sent it to Supportress.

### Watch

Watch a queue and receive email notifications whenever a new discussion lands. Never miss a new customer discussion.

### Forms

Each queue can expose a form through a unique URL. Point your customers to that form if you want them to use Supportress to start new discussions.
